# Shenbury: AI-Verified Asset Tokenization 神堡：AI鑑定的資產代幣化

## Project Overview 項目概述

Shenbury labs is focused on developing innovative solutions for asset verification and tokenization. Our core innovation centers on proprietary technology that solves critical challenges in the digital asset space.

Our core innovation is:
**The Technology:** Our proprietary Shenbury AI-Powered Protocol, a local-first AI swarm built to verify assets and solve the "oracle problem" for RWA tokenization.

For detailed technical documentation, our business model, and technology platform, please refer to our [Whitepaper](frontend/src/pages/Whitepaper.jsx).

## Key Technical Features 核心技術特性

Our Shenbury AI Protocol is our core technology, a decentralized, self-contained intelligent infrastructure.

### AI Agent Swarm AI代理群
- **Local Execution**: All AI processing runs locally without cloud dependencies.
- **Self-Contained Agents**: Independent operation with embedded knowledge bases.
- **Specialized Roles**: Dedicated agents for imaging, spectroscopy, and documentation analysis.
- **Closed-Loop Learning**: Continuous improvement through reinforcement feedback, trained by our in-house technology experts.

### Technical Architecture 技術架構
- **AgentDB**: Local vector database with HNSW indexing and 4-32x compression.
- **ReasoningBank**: Closed-loop learning system inspired by DeepMind's framework.
- **Local Embeddings**: transformers.js with Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (384-dimensional vectors).
- **No External Dependencies**: Fully autonomous operation without cloud services.

## Technology Platform

Our platform is built on our proprietary technology stack, including the Shenbury AI Agent Swarm, AgentDB vector database, and ReasoningBank closed-loop learning system. This technology represents years of research and development in autonomous AI systems for asset verification.
